== Description ==
The Custom Avatars plugin allows you to give visitors a custom avatar theme if they don't have a Gravatar. It was developed by <a href="http://ielectrify.com">iElectrify</a> and <a href="http://www.fahdmurtaza.com">Fahd Murtaza</a>.

Simply install the Custom Avatars plugin by following these steps:

1. Upload the 'custom-avatars' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

If your WordPress theme does not support avatars (which is rare), you can manually add the following snippet of code where you want the avatars to appear:

`<?php get_avatar(); ?>`

Avatars should be sized at 48x48 pixels. You can use a free graphics viewer/resizer such as IrfanView (available at www.irfanview.com) to resize your avatars. For themed icons that are free for personal and commercial use, visit www.iconfinder.net.

Once you have your avatars ready, upload them to the 'custom-avatars/images' folder in your WordPress plugins area. That's it! Enjoy!
